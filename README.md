# Hospitality Dashboard
This project is for the Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project By Code Institute.

This website was created to display in an interactive format some sales data provided by a catering equipment in the UK. The aim for the website is provide insights in how they performed for 2018 and 2019 (YTD).

You can view this website via Github Page by click this [link](https://robtych121.github.io/HospitalityDashboard/).
 
## UX
The website was designed with a corporate feel to it as it's going to be used by company sales managers/directors.

Because of this, the web page has a clean layout and everything has it's own section to the users can find the information they need easily.

I created a wireframe of the general layout of the page for both desktop and mobiles. This can be found under the Wireframes folder.

## Features
This website uses the data visualisation scripts D3, DC, Queue and Crossfilter to display a CSV file in a dashboard like web page. The page is structured using Bootstrap so it can also be used on mobiles without any issues.

### Features Left To Implement
I would like to implement an heat map using postcodes that shows all the different counties within the UK with a count of all the items they purchased.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. D3, DC, Queue, Crossfilter

## Testing


## Deployment
This website is hosted using the Github pages, using the master branch. Because of this, everytime i push across changes using Git, the website is automatically updated without any additional input from myself. When creating the website, i had to ensure that the main file for the website was index.html otherwise browsers wouldnt be able to load it properly.

If you want to run a copy of this website locally, please follow the following instructions:
1. Within your chosen editor/terminal, run the following command `git clone https://github.com/Robtych121/HospitalityDashboard.git`
2. Wait until the files have finished copying into your local folder
3. Once finished, run the following command `git remote rm origin`
4. You can now start changing code and commit changes without making changes to this repo.
